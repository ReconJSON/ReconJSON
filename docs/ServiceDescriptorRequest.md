### serviceDescriptor Request

[Please fill in here the details of what your serviceDescriptor is describing. When writing these sections, please use the verbiage described in RFC 2119.]

Example:

The `Path` serviceDescriptor SHALL be used to describe a single directory or file on a webserver. The `Path` object MUST be placed inside a list of element and correlated to the key `paths` in the `serviceDescriptors` attribute of a `service` object. If attribute values are not known, they MUST NOT be included unless specified otherwise in the description below.

[Please fill in here the details of each attribute for this object. When writing these sections, please use the verbiage described in RFC 2119.]

Example:


The `Path` object has the following attributes defined:
* `type`* - MUST be the type of object. In this case, `Path`
* `name`* - MUST be a descriptive name of what data this `serviceDescriptor` is describing
* `path`* - MUST be the path requested where path is defined by RFC 3986 section 3.3
* `screenshot` - MUST be the path to an image file that represents the contents of this endpoint
* `code` - MUST be the HTTP Status code returned by either a GET request (by default) or the HTTP Verb described in the `verb` attribute
* `contentType` - MUST be the content-type returned by either a GET request (by default) or the HTTP Verb described in the `verb` attribute
* `length` - MUST be the length of the request returned by either a GET request (by default) or the HTTP Verb described in the `verb` attribute
* `verb` - MUST be the the HTTP Verb used in the request to this path. By default this value SHOULD be assumed to be `GET`. However, `GET` MAY also be specified if so desired.
* `headers` - MUST be a map of relevant headers not included above
* `file` - MUST be the file requested by the path above
* `fileExt` - MUST be the file extention of the file requested by the path above. This MUST not contain the . (dot). For example, a valid entry would be `php` not `.php`
* `hash` - MUST be a map of hashtype to hash of this endpoint's content. This can be used to determine if the contents have changed or for forensic analysis
