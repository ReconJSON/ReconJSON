### httpUrl

The `httpUrl` `serviceDescriptor` SHALL be used to describe a single directory or file on a webserver. The `httpUrl` object strongly SHOULD be placed inside a list of element and correlated to the key `httpUrls` in the `serviceDescriptors` attribute of a `service` object. If attribute values are not known, they MUST NOT be included unless specified otherwise in the description below. The `httpUrl` `serviceDescriptor` MAY be used to describe both HTTPS and HTTP protocol.

Both the `host` and `scheme` fields SHOULD be derived from the context (`host` object and `service` object respectively). However, if there is a case where a tool wishes to return only the serviceDescriptor `httpUrl` then they may be used to describe the `host` and `service` to which this `httpUrl` belongs. 

The `httpUrl` object has the following attributes defined:
* `type`* - MUST be the type of object. In this case, `serviceDescriptor`
* `name`* - MUST be the name of this `serviceDescriptor`. In this case, `httpUrl`.
* `path`* - MUST be the relative path requested where path is defined by RFC 3986 section 4.2. MUST start with a slash.
* `verb`* - MUST be the the HTTP Verb used in the request to this path.
* `paramsContentType` - MUST be the format in which the `params` field is stored. The value of this field MUST be one of the following: application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, application/json, or application/xml. 
* `params` - MUST be any HTTP parameters sent along with this request. The format of the data stored in this field is described by `paramsContentType`. MUST NOT start with a `?` if placed in a GET request - this is a part of the structure not the parameter itself.
* `screenshot` - MUST be the path to an image file that represents the contents of this endpoint.
* `host` - MUST be the fully qualfied domain name that such that `host` + `path` defines the endpoint described. The scheme MUST NOT be included.
* `scheme` - MUST be either `http` or `https`. 
* `code` - MUST be the HTTP Status code returned by the HTTP Verb described in the `verb` attribute. This attribute MUST be an integer. 
* `contentType` - MUST be the content-type returned by  the HTTP Verb described in the `verb` attribute
* `length` - MUST be the length of the request returned by the HTTP Verb described in the `verb` attribute. This attribute MUST be an integer. 
* `headers` - MUST be a map of relevant headers not included above.
* `file` - MUST be the file requested by the path above.
* `fileExt` - MUST be the file extention of the file requested by the path above. This MUST not contain the . (dot). For example, a valid entry would be `php` not `.php`.
* `hash` - MUST be a map of hashtype to hash of this endpoint's content. This can be used to determine if the contents have changed or for forensic analysis.
* `data` - Must be the path to the file containing the data returned in the body of this request. 

\* Required attributes

Example:
```
{"type":"service","protocol":"http","banner":"Apache 1.0","serviceDescriptors":{"httpUrls":[{"type":"serviceDescriptor","name":"httpUrl","path":"/testing/test.php","screenshot":"/root/screenshots/screenshot.jpg","code":200,"contentType":"text/html","length":1024,"verb":"POST","headers":{"Server":"Apache"},"file":"test.php","fileExt":"php","hash":{"md5":"8eab2974f483d66532d8e44120877c14"}}]}}
```
